# infant-mortality-dashboard
This Shiny dashboard (R) provides an interactive platform for the analysis and visualization of infant mortality data, integrating statistical modeling and survival function estimation.
The tool is designed to support research into mortality determinants, temporal trends, and infant survival probabilities, using publicly available data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).. By integrating interactive analytics with survival analysis, it enhances the interpretability and accessibility of statistical findings in health research.
